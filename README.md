#tree23

##Description
A 2-3 tree implemented in C.

##Dependencies
* This program readily compiles with the latest version of gcc. I do not use 
any non-standard features or extensions, so any version of gcc should suffice.

##Usage (for now)
   make && ./mktree

##History
In the year 2013, after completing my Data Structures course, I figured that
I ought to implement some of the more complex items we went over in class but
only touched on at a high level. I found the 2-3 tree to be very cool and thought
it incredible that one could search for any element contained within in O(logn)
iterations.

I set out to implement this tree, but was baffled by several cases my specific
design would have to consider. Thus, I was unable to complete the project before
my first semester at UTSA, and now, two years later, I have given it a go again.
